        <h1>Athanasias</h1>
        <h2>by Plato</h2>
        <p>SOCRATES: Why have you come to me so late in the day, dear Athanasias?</p>
        <p>ATHANASIAS: I want to know how to achieve immortality!</p>
        <p>SOCRATES: Really? Why?</p>
        <p>ATHANASIAS: I want to be a god! I want the power to rival Zeus!</p>
        <p>SOCRATES: But is such a thing a noble goal?</p>
        <p>ATHANASIAS: Screw nobility! I want power!</p>
        <p>SOCRATES: Okay, then let me tell you how to achieve immortality, since you so relentlessly insist upon it.</p>
        <p>ATHANASIAS: Finally! Thank you. I swear, if you teach me how to become immortal, I will never ask for anything else again.</p>
        <p>SOCRATES: Yes, you've been quite needy lately. But here is the secret to immorality: Love your neighbor as yourself.</p>
        <p>ATHANASIAS: What!? That's not an answer. There has to be an actual answer! You can't just give me a fake out.</p>
        <p>SOCRATES: Can't I?</p>
        <p>ATHANASIAS: Stop answering my questions with questions! Just tell me straight out how to live forever.</p>
        <p>SOCRATES: Fine. Lean in closer, and I will whisper it to you. I can't have everyone in the world finding out how to live forever. I must parcel out this knowledge one bit at a time.</p>
        <p>ATHANASIAS: Sure! Alright. I'm bending over, and I'm listening. Just waiting for you tell me how to live forever.</p>
        <p>SOCRATES (whispering): No one gets to live forever, you annoying brute. And that is why I must kill you now!</p>
        <p>ATHANASIAS: Ahhh! You're stabbing me! Damn my knowledge! It has led me to my doom.</p>
        <p>SOCRATES: I hope you learned a valuable lesson, dear Athanasias.</p>
        <p>ATHANASIAS: I did. And now I must die.</p>
        <p>SOCRATES: And that's why people should never bother me late in the day. I just want to enjoy a good sunset for once. Geeze!</p>
