        <h1>Hemocrates</h1>
        <h2>by Plato</h2>
        <p>SOCRATES: Now, Hemocrates, after Timaeus and Critias have laid out their ideas on unified field theory, I think it's your turn to explain how the universe came to be.</p>
        <p>TIMAEUS: And where to find the lost city of Atlantis!</p>
        <p>SOCRATES: Yes, that is equally as important as understanding the origin of the universe.</p>
        <p>HEMOCRATES: Oh, actually, I don't know.</p>
        <p>SOCRATES: What?</p>
        <p>HEMOCRATES: Yeah, I was just hoping you would all forget to ask me. I know literally nothing. I've just been sitting around soaking up the wisdom of the great Socrates for free. Oh, and also the certainly adequate wisdoms imparted by the estimable Timaeus and Critias.</p>
        <p>CRITIAS: You old dog!</p>
        <p>SOCRATES: Well, I guess there is no unified field theory. Oh, well!</p>
        <p>TIMAEUS: Shall we eat grapes?</p>
        <p>SOCRATES: Shall we?</p>
