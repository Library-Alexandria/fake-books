        <h1>The History of the Peloponnesian War, Part II</h1>
        <h2>by Thucydides</h2>
        <p>After Tissaphernes offered his sacrifices to Artemis at Ephesus, he continued his travels to Hellespont to defend himself against the charges against him, including the question of the Phoenician ships. He began with a speech.</p>
        <p>"First of all, can we just all agree that at least I'm no Alcibiades? I mean, what team is that dude even on? All this ship drama is really small potatoes when you start comparing my actions to his. Shouldn't we save all this hand wringing for him? No? Fine. My defense. Here it is, exactly as I said it, with no embellishments. You can rest assured that if you are reading these words on a scroll some years from now that what you are about to read is verbatim what I am saying. Someone reliable is totally witnessing it and setting it down to memory. Yay for our Greek oral culture! Anywhosie-doosie, so, the ships: Yeah, I messed up. But haven't we all messed up? At one point or another? Cough, couch, Alcibiades. I don't mean to deflect, but c'mon. I guess I'm not a perfect orator. Dude in the audience who's memorizing everything I'm saying, could you maybe pep it up a bit when you transcribe this speech? Make me sound more Homeric, less not Homeric. You know what I mean. Anyway, don't kill me? Peace."</p>
        <p>The stunned audience at Hellespont had to agree that Tissaphernes was not Alcibiades. But they craved blood. So they executed Tissaphernes. And that was the last important thing to ever happen in the Peloponnesian War. The end.</p>
